# 🌍 Wenda — Smart Tourism Platform in Angola

**Wenda** is a digital platform that leverages **Machine Learning** and **geospatial data analysis** to strengthen the tourism industry in Angola.
The name **Wenda** comes from *Umbundu* and means *“journey”*.

The project’s mission is to **boost the tourism sector** by supporting **public managers, businesses, and travelers** with insights, forecasts, and personalized recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Wenda combines technology, data, and artificial intelligence to:

* **Predict tourism demand** across different regions of the country
* **Help managers and agencies** make data-driven decisions
* **Provide personalized recommendations** to travelers through a mobile app
* **Centralize information** about destinations, events, and tourism services

The platform is divided into three main components:

| Component                           | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Dashboard (Wenda Dashboard)** | Administrative interface for government and tourism operators — displays charts, forecasts, interactive maps, and reports. |
| **Mobile App (Wenda App)**          | App for tourists to discover attractions, generate smart itineraries, and receive AI-driven recommendations.               |
| **Backend Services (APIs)**         | Set of Python-based APIs — one focused on CRUD operations and another dedicated to Machine Learning.                       |
